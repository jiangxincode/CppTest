通过CppCheck检查，修复以下问题：

* The scope of the variable 'xxx' can be reduced.
* Variable 'term' is reassigned a value before the old one has been used.
* scanf without field width limits can crash with huge input data on some versions of libc.
* Obsolete function 'gets' called. It is recommended to use the function 'fgets' instead.
* Redundant code: Found a statement that begins with numeric constant.
* %d in format string (no. 1) requires 'int' but the argument type is 'unsigned int'.
* Array 'm[10]' accessed at index 10, which is out of bounds.
